### Note ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
I generally do not accept commits or changes to my projects. While I appreciate you taking the time to want to improve my code with your ideas, these are projects I've created for myself and choose to share with others. On occasion I accept changes when it is something I feel would be a benefit to my own use of the tool, otherwise I generally deny them.
